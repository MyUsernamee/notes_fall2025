\bcent
(a) Show that the three vectors $v_1 = (0, 3, 1, -1)$, $v_2 = (6, 0, 5, 1)$, and $v_3 = (4, -7, 1, 3)$ form a linearly dependent set in $R^4$.
(b) Express each vector in part (a) as a linear combination of the other two.

# 15. Are the vectors $\mathbf{v}_1$, $\mathbf{v}_2$, and $\mathbf{v}_3$ in part (a) of the accompanying figure linearly independent? What about those in part (b)? Explain.

\bcent
(a) Yes, all vector lie on different planes. No two vectors lie on the same plane.
(b) No. All vectors lie on a 2D plane, therefore they cannot be linearly independent.

(Calculus required) Use the Wronskian to show that the functions $f_1(x) = \sin x$, $f_2(x) = \cos x$, and $f_3(x) = x \cos x$ are linearly independent vectors in $C^{\infty}(-\infty, \infty)$.
