\subsubsection*{ 1) }

Let V be the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers, and consider the following addition and scalar multiplication operations on $u = (u_1, u_2)$ and $v = (v_1, v_2)$:

\[ u + v = (u_1 + v_1, u_2 + v_2),\quad ku = (0, ku_2) \]

(a) Compute $u + v$ and $ku$ for $u = (-1, 2)$, $v = (3, 4)$, and $k = 3$. \\
(b) In words, explain why $V$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. \\
(c) Since addition on $V$ is the standard addition operation on $R^2$, certain vector space axioms hold for $V$ because they are known to hold for $R^2$. Which axioms are they? \\
(d) Show that Axioms 7, 8, and 9 hold. \\
(e) Show that Axiom 10 fails and hence that $V$ is not a vector space under the given operations. \\
\vfill

\subsubsection*{ 5) In Exercises 3â€“12, determine whether each set equipped withthe given operations is a vector space. For those that are not vectorspaces identify the vector space axioms that fail. }

The set of all pairs of real numbers of the form $(x, y)$, where $x \ge 0$, with the standard operations on $R^2$.

\subsubsection*{ 7) }

The set of all triples of real numbers with the standard vector addition but with scalar multiplication defined by

\[ k(x, y, z) = (k_2x, k_2y, k_2z) \]
\vfill

\subsubsection*{ 9) }

The set of all $2 \times 2$ matrices of the form
\[ \begin{bmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{bmatrix} \]
\vfill

\subsubsection*{ 11) }

The set of all pairs of real numbers of the form $(1, x)$ with the operations
\[ (1, y) + (1, y') = (1, y + y') && \text{ and } && k(1, y) = (1, ky) \]
