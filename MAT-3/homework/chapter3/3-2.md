#1 b)

In Exercises 1–2, find the norm of $v$, and a unit vector that is oppositely directed to $v$.

\[ 
    v = (1, 0, 2, 1, 3) 
\]

#3 d)

In Exercises 3–4, evaluate the given expression with \mathbf{u} = (2, -2, 3), \mathbf{v} = (1, -3, 4), \text{ and } \mathbf{w} = (3, 6, -4).

\[ 
\|\mathbf{u}\| - \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

#5 b)

In Exercises 5–6, evaluate the given expression with $\mathbf{u} = (-2, -1, 4, 5)$, $\mathbf{v} = (3, 1, -5, 7)$, and $\mathbf{w} = (-6, 2, 1, 1)$.
